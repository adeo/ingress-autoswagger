# Ingress Autoswagger
A small Go application creates UI for APIs for services with OpenAPI JSON endpoints.

**When it's useful:** You're running a set of microservices on top of Kubernetes and expose them with Ingress on sub-paths.
Each of them has OpenAPI `/api-docs` of their APIs.
Start Ingress Autoswagger in the root `/` path, specify names of services and you will get a single Swagger UI for all services.

## How it works
Assume, you have three microservices `cart`, `delivery`, and `payment` deployed on the same host.
To make this work, each application should expose [Open API JSON](https://swagger.io/specification/) on `/{version}/api-docs`. 
For example:

* `/cart/v3/api-docs`
* `/delivery/v3/api-docs`
* `/payment/v3/api-docs`

Then, run this application with environment variable `SERVICES=["cart", "delivery", "payment"]"` and expose to `/`.
The application finds the right version of the specification for each service and periodically checks the liveness of the applications.

## Supported environment variables

* **SERVICES** *`required`* array of services to look up
* **VERSIONS**  *`default: ["v2", "v3"]`* array of versions of specifications used in microservices
* **APIDOCS_EXTENSION**  *`default: ""`* string variable for swagger url suffix used in microservices. 
* Can be `"yml"` for url: service/v3/api-docs.yml
* Must be passed through `discoveringApidocsExtension: "yml"` in values.yaml 
* **REFRESH_CRON** *`default: @every 1m`* schedule for check liveness of applications

## Usage

### With helm (stored inside LMRU, needs to be builded for external setups)

```bash
helm repo add lmru https://art.lmru.tech/helm
helm upgrade --install --namespace \
 --set services={plaster-calculator,product-binder} --set hostname=$hostname --set version=3.2 \
 $namespace $release-name lmru/ingress-autoswagger
```

### With docker (stored inside LMRU, needs to be builded for external setups)

```bash
docker run -it -e SERVICES="[\"plaster-calculator\",\"product-binder\"]" -e VERSIONS="[\"v2\",\"v3\"]" docker-devops.art.lmru.tech/bricks/ingress-autoswagger:3.1
```

### Without docker

```bash
SERVICES="[\"plaster-calculator\",\"product-binder\"]" VERSIONS="[\"v2\",\"v3\"]" go run ingress-autoswagger.go 
```

After run you can open http://localhost:3000 in browser.

## Development & Build

1. The tool written in simple Go language, so one that you need is to have installed Go.
1. Install dependencies `go get -u github.com/gobuffalo/packr/packr`
1. Build with packr (syntax the same with typical 'go build' command) `packr build .`
